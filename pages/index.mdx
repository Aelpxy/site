I am a software developer with experience in a variety of programming languages, including Go, TypeScript, and Rust. I am passionate about using the right tool for the job and am always looking to learn new technologies and programming languages. In my current role, I am responsible for designing and implementing scalable backend systems using Go and TypeScript, as well as developing and maintaining web applications with Rust. I am comfortable working with a variety of tools and technologies, and always looking to expand my skillset. I have a passion for clean, efficient code and am always looking for ways to improve the performance and reliability of the systems I work on. I enjoy working collaboratively with others to solve complex problems.
