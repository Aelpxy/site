## hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer proficient in TypeScript and Go, with occasional experience in Rust. I enjoy working with complex infrastructures. While my primary focus is on backend engineering, where I have the most experience, I do frontend development occasionally, but not extensively.

I treat software development as a creative art rather than work. I prioritize performance and security as my primary focus when building something.
