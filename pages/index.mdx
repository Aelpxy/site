## hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer proficient in TypeScript and Go with years of experience, currently serving as the CTO at [Pandabase](https://pandabase.io). I also have occasional experience in Rust. I enjoy working with complex infrastructures. While my primary focus is on backend engineering, where I have the most experience, I occasionally do frontend development.

 I consider software development to be a creative art rather than just work. I prioritize performance and security as my primary focuses when building something.
