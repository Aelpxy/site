### Step 1

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the keys.

### Step 2

Run the following command to generate a private key:

```sh
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
```

This will create a private key file called private.pem in the current directory.

### Step 3

Run the following command to generate a public key:

```sh
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

This will create a public key file called public.pem in the current directory.

> Note: Keep the private key secret and secure. Do not share it with anyone. The public key can be shared with others freely.
