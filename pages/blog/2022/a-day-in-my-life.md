Okay. First, don't blame me.

I haven't written a single line of code today. Nothing exciting happened. Woke up at 7:35 AM, after that went to school.
Came home at 2:28 PM.

What have I learned?
Literally nothing related to programming.

I guess going to sleep at 12:00 AM today.

Have a good day if you're reading from future!
