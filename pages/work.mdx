  I'm currently on a mission to improve the e-commerce industry. We're building
  a digital e-commerce platform for the next generation of entrepreneurs.

      At the beginning of 2023, we recognized a need for an ecommerce platform.
      While there are many available, they are often costly and time-consuming
      to configure. We simply wanted something that works. So, with the backing
      of Velta, LLC, Pavv and I founded Pandabase. Since then, we have over
      2,000 commits across all Pandabase repositories, and we are steadily
      growing our user base.

      In the beginning of 2022, Pavv and I decided we needed to create something
      new and innovative. We founded Velta, LLC, a Florida-based company and the
      parent company of Aurevo. This is where my actual journey began. We've
      built edge networks, worked with Points of Presence (PoPs), and utilized
      edge networking solutions like Akamai and AWS extensively.

      Aurevo was building cloud computing solutions for companies of all sizes,
      including managed databases and other technologies. During my time at
      Aurevo, I gained a lot of experience on the backend managing complex
      infrastructure. I worked with NGINX, Docker, Kubernetes, HAProxy, and
      Kafka during this period.
